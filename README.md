# 401k_optimize

## Overview of Project
There are enough statistics available through the media to terify just about anyone into investing towards their retirement. And for a long time, one of the primary vehicles for every day working Americans is the 401k. The goal of this project is to provide a little bit of education, a slight bit of objectivity, and hopefully a useful tool to optimize your 401k contributions as you save for retirement.

### Purpose of Project
You just got a new job; congratulations! And even better, your new employer offers you the opportunity to invest in a 401k. Awesome. Maybe you get to sign up day one, or perhaps you have to wait a month. Whatever the case is, you log in to your shiny new 401k provider. And they start asking you questions. And not just one or two easy to answer questions, but things like, "How do you want to diversity your portfolio?". My who what? Rather quickly you have discovered that it's possible for you to custom design your investment portfolio in your 401k. And you get choices! Lots of them.

Depending on which investment bank is hosting your company's 401k program, you may have a variety of choices. Things like:
  * American Funds American Mutual R6
  * iShares MSCI EAFE Intl Idx K
...and more.

And you ask yourself the inevitable question: which one are you supposed to choose? Oh wait. Not which one, but I can choose <i>more</i> than one?! And I have to choose what percentage of my contributions I want to allocate to each choice?

If you're like most people, including my wife (love you, darling) you toss your hands in the air, and select:
* Vanguard Target Retirement 20XX Inv

And who's to blame you? Some of these investment banks offer twenty-five or more possible choices for you to allocate your nest-egg into. Who has time to research how you are supposed to diversify a 401k, which options help you meet your financial goals, and still leave enough time after your day job to enjoy your night life?

I agree with you. It's overwhelming. And then I did a six-month intensive coding bootcamp and dipped my toes into the world of data science, python programming, machine learning, and application development. And I thought: you know what would be cool, is to try and help everyone make better investment choices and hopefully make the world a better and more financially peaceful kind of place.

So welcome. Welcome to my answer to all of these dilemnas. Simply input which company hosts your 401k, and let the power of data science, analysis and machine learning do all of the research for you. In a few seconds you'll get an answer kicked out, you can allocate your 401k, and you can smile and go live your life. I hope nothing more than to make your life a easier, and provide a bit of confidence that you're doing everything you can to build your future.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Gathering all of the data
Let's define in a bit more detail what we're trying to do. What we want is a tool to analyze all of the possible investment options that we might have in our 401k. This immediately presents two issues.
1. Which mutual funds are we going to analyze?
2. What metrics are we going to use to analyze performance?
3. Where do we get the data for each mutual fund so that we can perform analysis?
4. How do we know we can trust this data and be confident in the outcome of what is essentially a forecast model?
